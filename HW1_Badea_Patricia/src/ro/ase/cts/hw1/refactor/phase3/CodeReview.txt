Code review

1. Code structure & naming conventions

- the package name is too generic;
- the class name is too generic;
- the functions' names are not suggestive;
- the functions' arguments' names are not suggestive;
- lowerCamelCase usage in arguments' names
- parameters and operators sepatared by space

2. Implementation

- the appereance of "magic numbers"(harcoded values)
- is accountType limited or it can be bigger?
- adding validations for parameters using exceptions

3. Single responsibility & KISS

- out-sourcing the intermediary operations into new simple functions

4. Reduce the complexity of the existing functions -  Single responsibility & KISS

-reducing the complexity of the repeating pattern (calculateTotalFee)
-removing the switch by refactoring it

5. Single Responsbibility and Depedency Inversion 

-refactoring the custom exceptions framework using interfaces
