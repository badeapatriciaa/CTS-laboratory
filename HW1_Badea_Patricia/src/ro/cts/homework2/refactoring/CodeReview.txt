Code review

1. Code structure & naming conventions
- modifying package name, class name, functions and arguments name into names that are more suggestive
- refactoring the design of the code

2. Implementation
- hardcoded values
- manage accountType into enum
- validations with exception for parameters 

3. Single responsibility & KISS
- out-sourcing the intermediary operations into simpler operations
